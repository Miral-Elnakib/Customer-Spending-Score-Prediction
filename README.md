# Customer-Spending-Score-Prediction
# Customer Spending Score Prediction

Predicting customer spending behavior using machine learning regression techniques.

## Overview
This project implements a **Customer Spending Score Prediction System** using regression models to analyze and predict customer spending behavior based on demographic and financial features. The dataset includes attributes such as **Gender, Age, and Annual Income**, with the target variable being **Spending Score (1-100)**. Two approaches are explored:

- **Neural Network** built with TensorFlow
- **Linear Regression** model from scikit-learn

Performance is evaluated using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.

The project is implemented in **Python** using a **Jupyter Notebook**, leveraging libraries like **pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn** for data processing, visualization, and modeling.

## Features
### Data Preprocessing
- Loads and cleans the dataset (`Project_Idea_5.csv`).
- Encodes categorical variables (e.g., **Gender: Male=1, Female=0**).
- Drops unnecessary columns (e.g., **CustomerID**).

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizes data distributions and relationships.

### Modeling
- **Neural Network**: A custom-built model using TensorFlow/Keras for regression.
- **Linear Regression**: A baseline model using scikit-learn.

### Evaluation
- Compares model performance using **MSE, MAE, and RMSE**.
- Visualizes **training/validation loss** and **predictions vs. true values**.

### Visualization
- Plots **model loss over epochs**.
- Displays **scatter plots of predictions**.

## Dataset
The dataset (`Project_Idea_5.csv`) contains **200 customer records** with the following columns:

- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier (dropped during preprocessing).
- **Gender**: Male or Female (encoded as **1 or 0**).
- **Age**: Customer age (18â€“70).
- **Annual Income (k$)**: Yearly income in thousands (15â€“137).
- **Spending Score (1-100)**: Target variable, representing spending behavior (1â€“99).

ðŸ“Œ **Ensure the dataset file is placed in the project directory before running the notebook.**

## Results
### Neural Network:
âœ… Achieves a **reasonable fit** with an **MSE of 0.2441** and **MAE of 0.3602** on the test set.
âœ… Loss decreases steadily over epochs (**see model_loss.png**).

### Linear Regression:
âœ… **Outperforms** the neural network with **near-perfect predictions** (**MSE â‰ˆ 2.6e-28, MAE â‰ˆ 1.25e-14**).
âœ… Suggests a **strong linear relationship** in the data.

### Visualizations:
ðŸ“ˆ **Loss Curve**: Shows training and validation loss convergence.
ðŸ“Š **Scatter Plot**: Compares true vs. predicted spending scores for both models (**red = linear, blue = neural network**).

## Future Enhancements
ðŸ”¹ Add **feature engineering** (e.g., interaction terms, polynomial features).
ðŸ”¹ Experiment with **more complex neural network architectures** (e.g., deeper layers, dropout).
ðŸ”¹ Incorporate **cross-validation** for robust evaluation.
ðŸ”¹ Develop a **web interface** for interactive predictions using **Flask or Streamlit**.
